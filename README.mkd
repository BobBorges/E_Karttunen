Dependencies
------------
E_Karttunen is a Python 3 program using only standard libraries.


Usage
-----
E_Karttunen is a Python 3 program. First, you need to find out which version of Python is installed in your system

* Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and type `python --version`. 
    * If you get no output you need to install Python. Go to python.org/downloads and chose a recent version, python 3.6 or higher, which is right for your system.
    * If you get `python 3.6.x` or higher, you will use `python` to call W_Karttunen.
    * If you get `python 2.x.x`, try to enter `python3 --version`. If you get `python 3.6.x` or higher, you will call E_Karttunen with the `python3` command. 
    * If you have a python 2 version but not a python 3 version, be sure to carefully examine how to install python3 without overriding your python2 install (overriding python2 might have drastic consequences for your system â€“ learn from my mistake). Install python 3.6.x or higher.

Download or clone this repository to your system (and unzip the files if you downloaded a zip file). Use your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you downloaded the repository.

To start E_Karttunen, initiate it via your python 3.6.x or higher program file. For me it's `python3` so I enter

        python3 E_Karttunen.py

in my command line interface in order to start the program.
